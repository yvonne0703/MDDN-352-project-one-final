                <!-- This is a standard paragraph. --><strong>Overview</strong><br>
                based on the example of <em>'Victoria University Library
Interactive 3D virtual tool to access objects in the library collection i.e Vitra Chairs'</em>, <br>it discussed about a virtual tool which provide a clear high-quality interaction image for students, in particular, to use and repurpose for their studies and research. It enhanced and extended access to fragile resources, can continue to use these resources while also reducing physical wear and tear with the 3D interactive virtual tools.<br><br> The example explain <em>'Objects such as the Vitra Chairs and the design theses are both susceptible to damage. Regular handling can cause wear and tear if the handler unwittingly exerts too much pressure while touching or moving the objects, causing parts to snap or break. Accidents can cause irreparable damage that will compromise the integrity of the models and designs, possibly destroying or altering them.'</em><br>and also <em>'These objects can also be eroded by the bacteria and oils that humans naturally carry on our skin. At the moment, all users have to wear protective gloves when interacting with the objects.'</em><br><br>So the challenge of the example is create a 3D/holographic aspect with clear high quality interaction image tool and accessible from the library website for students to use in relevant format for their research and studies.<br>For my challenge will be based on the existing and addition of AR technology which can also present them in the real world.</p>

                    <h3><strong>Why use AR?</strong><br>
In many cases, for industrial design, works that are satisfied on a computer screen may not be satisfactory when they are put into the real world. AR technology can help designers see the effect of interacting with the real world in advance before making a final product.</h3>
